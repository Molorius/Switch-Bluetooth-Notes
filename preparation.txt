    Note that this was done on a Raspberry Pi running Debian Stretch, kernel 4.14.98.

    Change the bluetooth name to Nintendo Switch (or whatever you want) with:
sudo hciconfig hci0 name 'Nintendo Switch' # change name
sudo hciconfig hci0 down # turn off bluetooth device
sudo hciconfig hci0 up   # turn back on with new name

    Many things, such as sdptool, are broken in later builds. Fix this by changing:
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd
    to:
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --compat
    in:
/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service
    then reload with:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
